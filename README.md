This collection refers to data used to generate all figures presented in the manuscript “Transmission dynamics of Oropouche virus in Latin America and the Caribbean” under peer review. All statistical computing analyses were conducted using RStudio, version 4.4.1. R packages necessary for analysis and visualization were biscale 1.0.0, censobr 0.4.0, dplyr 1.1.4, geobr 1.9.0, ggbreak 0.1.2, ggplot2 3.5.1, lubridate 1.9.3, MVSE 1.0, raster 3.6-26, RColorBrewer 1.1-3, readxl 1.4.3, rnaturalearth 1.0.1, rnaturalearthdata 1.0.0, Rsero 2.0, sf 1.0-16, stringr 1.5.1, terra 1.8-4.2, tidyverse 2.0.0, tmap 3.3-4, randomForestSRC 4.7-1.2, rstan 2.32.7, and stats 4.4.1. Figures 3A and 3B were generated using Prism (GraphPad). No custom code was developed. De-identified individual-level data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health can be provided for research purposes after approval by a committee on human experimentation (if applicable). This data can be obtained upon request to the corresponding authors (William M. de Souza, wmdesouza@uky.edu; Ester C. Sabino, sabinoec@usp.br, and Jose Luiz Proenca-Modena, jlmodena@unicamp.br). The estimated response time from the corresponding authors may be up to three weeks.<img width="468" height="202" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90f6a796-baee-4946-922f-bc9ad23cc69f" />
